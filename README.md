# simple-emite-api

Provides a simple plain-javascript object model for emite to allow implementors to easily create rich chat applications without all this tedious mucking about with GWT.

This abstracts out the major functions of a chap application into a set of objects which can be tied into a Model-View-Whatever framework.
